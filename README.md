Assignment Details
Code provided this week was not in semantic html. Reviewed html code to edit necessary tags, so it would present like your typcial html code. Removed or editted exisiting div tags with html tags main, aside, footer, and so on. Also made sure all links worked and directed to corresponding areas in main section. Added alt tags to all images for accesibility of screen readers. CSS file was out of logical order. Adjusted so it flowed (header --> main --> aside --> footer). There were a handful of redundent classes in main and aside. Renamed and assigned classes to eliminate redundent styling code lines.
